  creating xorg.conf (in non --auto)

Version 0.32 - 26 September 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- monitor-probe-using-X can now return EDIDs. if Xorg find an EDID (whereas

Version 0.24 - 7 September 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- do not configure XFS, it's useless
- fix default_headers (ie allow XFdrake to create xorg.conf from scratch again)
- keep the order from MonitorsDB file 
  (allows "Flat Panel 800x600" to be before "Flat Panel 1024x768")
