Version 0.95 - 16 November 2012 akdengi <akdengi>
- Update alternatives fix. Using /usr/sbin/update-alternatives --set 
directly instead common::function.

Version 0.94 - 12 November 2012 akdengi <akdengi>
- Fix nokmsboot option in Grub2 moving
- Fix ru(winkeys) error

Version 0.93 - 17 August 2012, by Per Ã˜yvind Karlsen <peroyvind@mandriva.org>

- load evdev slightly earlier and in actual time before required
- do not install bootloader when configuring X during install.
  this will be done at end of summary to allow selecting where
  to install bootloader (mga#5044)
- fix crash regression (mga#5238)
- display_driver_helper:
  o drop support for unused and unuseful --check-initrd option
  o allow use of nouveau without xorg.conf as it is now autoselected by
    X server in that case
  o load radeon module with modeset=0 when no firmware is installed
    (see mga#3466)
  o report KMS as not allowed with --is-kms-allowed on radeon hardware
    without radeon firmware, so that 'nokmsboot' will be used on such
    cases
  o add --setup-boot-kms action which sets/unsets 'nokmsboot' boot
    option as necessary
- do not generate a xorg.conf symlink pointing to nothing if
  xorg.conf.standard exists
- do not run setxkbmap during text install
- handle drivers needing firmware (mga#1471, mga#3421, mga#3466)
- handle drivers needing SSE
- convert mouse helper to use udevadm in order to work with udev 175+
- default to 24bit with QXL driver (16 bit doesn't work)
- do not offer to try KMS drivers during installation (mga#3711)
- display_driver_helper: use the new modprobe --resolve-alias instead
  of manually parsing --dry-run output
- fix path to 'loadkeys'
- runlevel: Ensure that systemd targets corresponding to the required
  runlevel are also updated (in addition to inittab).
- fallback to X server run-time autodetection on laptops instead of
  1024x768 when the monitor could not be probed (Mageia #1059)
- do not try to probe monitor information via X server on laptops (it
  doesn't work with recent X servers)
- add support for Asturian keyboard
- prefer boot display devices when probing cards (fixes at least an issue
  with an SLI laptop as reported by Maarten Vanraes)
- harddrake: configure default resolution (and background) even if card
  configuration fails (useful if vbox video driver is not available)
- evdev needs to be loaded before calling getInputDevices_and_usb
  else it will lead to a crash (pterjan)
- display_driver_helper: do not load radeon driver if the proprietary
  driver is temporarily disabled on a PowerXpress system
- display_driver_helper: allow automatic loading of the implicit driver
  on systems without xorg.conf if the presence of other files indicates
  that this is not a live cd boot before automatic X.org configuration
  (fixes radeon KMS without xorg.conf)

Version 0.92 - 21 April 2011

- disable debug output of display_driver_helper by default
- fix ahead-of-X-server loading of proprietary and fglrx kernel modules
- try unloading unconfigured drivers in "display_driver_helper --check-loaded"

Version 0.91 - 17 April 2011

- use UseEdid instead of IgnoreEDID with nvidia96xx since the latter is
  obsolete (#40006)
- remove "3D hardware acceleration" from the UI, it will always be enabled
  by default since we unconditionnally add the "dri" module to xorg.conf now
  (#58933) 
- add display_driver_helper script (used by XFdrake, udev, drakx, dkms)
- add/remove nokmsboot boot option as needed
- ask for reboot instead of X server restart, as it is commonly needed

Version 0.90 - 26 May 2010

- translation updates

Version 0.89 - 11 May 2010

- mouse:
  o remove imwheel support

Version 0.88 - 25 February 2010

- rename wacom driver package to its current name
- remove obsoleted video drivers from video driver list, add some new ones

Version 0.87 - 9 February 2010

- XFdrake:
  o use -X option for ldconfig when switching alternatives, we only need the
    cache rebuilt (Anssi Hannula)
  o do not disable Composite extension by default when using fglrx driver
    (Anssi Hannula)
  o do not disable loading of dri module for non-glx drivers, as KMS drivers
    require it as well
  o do not disable loading of glx module for fbdev, in order to allow AIGLX
    to work in software rasterizer mode
  o do not add dbe and extmod modules to xorg.conf anymore, they are loaded
    by default anyway

Version 0.86 - 26 November 2009

- keyboarddrake:
    o make sure to properly init the console keymap before dumping it during
      initial configuration, should fix console keymap setting in finish-install

Version 0.85 - 22 October 2009

- mousedrake:
    o fix input module path on 64 bit machines
    o don't install input drivers if X isn't here
- XFdrake:
    o enable ctrl+alt+backspace by default

Version 0.84 - 9 October 2009

- run ldconfig after update-alternatives during installer too
  (psb alternative does not have a higher priority than standard
   alternative, and ldconfig was run by the installer only before
   manually setting the alternative, which was not enough)

Version 0.83 - 8 October 2009

- use 28.8kHz as lower HorizSync (for 800x480)

Version 0.82 - 23 September 2009

- don't consider xorg.conf files with no InputDevice sections as invalid, fixes   bug reported on cooker mailing list

Version 0.81 - 23 September 2009

- add psb driver support (for Poulsbo chipset)

Version 0.80 - 22 September 2009

  o fix DontZap option issue with old xorg.conf files
- allow to skip framebuffer setup (and thus splash removal) for newer
  harddrake releases

Version 0.78 - 9 September 2009

- XFdrake:
  o added "Disable Ctrl-Alt-Backspace" option

Version 0.77 - 22 July 2009

- XFdrake:
  o correctly detect proprietary drivers that are located in
    /usr/lib/drivername/xorg (#52384)

Version 0.76 - 25 June 2009

- keyboarddrake: 
  o update the xkb HAL keys when the keyboard layout is changed so that it
    persists after a X server restart. Bug #49725
- XFdrake:
  o when probing for video cards, ignore cards which are not in the VIDEO_VGA
    PCI class (it is pretty common for dual-head ATI cards to have a
    VIDEO_OTHER device for example). This has the potential of breaking
    dual head setups, so it needs careful testing in Cooker ;) See bug #48028
  o fix crash when both monitor and driver can not be probed (in
    harddrake service or XFdrake --auto), for example with some Quanta
    IL1 netbooks using Chrome9 IC3

Version 0.74 - 22 April 2009

- mousedrake:
  o fix vmmouse configuration for vmware (#49654)

Version 0.73 - 21 April 2009

- tweak Intel driver accel methods in xorg.conf so that it's more consistent
  with what the new Intel driver expects.

Version 0.72 - 15 April 2009

- XFdrake:
  o fix selecting proprietary drivers with xdriver=DRIVER boot option
  o do not add Load "freetype" to xorg.conf as the module does not exist
    anymore
  o use Plug'n'Play monitor when in vbox and don't specify any default
    resolution, fixes #49642

Version 0.71 - 2 April 2009

- XFdrake:
  o add support for xdriver=DRIVER kernel boot option that affects
    non-interactive device autodetection, e.g. One boot
    (special value xdriver=free disables proprietary drivers)
  o add nouveau driver into the driver list

Version 0.70 - 20 March 2009

- mousedrake:
  o configure input driver as 'vmmouse' if running in vmware (#29106)
  o test if the file is there before trying to install the packages, that saves 
    a rpm -q in harddrake service after adding/removing/changing a mouse
- XFdrake:
  o adapt for recent changes in proprietary driver alternatives

Version 0.69 - 29 January 2009

- XFdrake:

    changing keyboard

Version 0.67 - 8 January 2009

- mousedrake:
  o synaptics driver in now in package x11-driver-input-synaptics (#45531)

Version 0.66 - 18 December 2008

- keyboarddrake:
  o do not configure hal directly, but write in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard Xkb
    information so hal can get them
  o new option "--migrate" which adds Xkb information in
    /etc/sysconfig/keyboard
  o correctly handle default XkbModel
    (so that we do not force pc105 when we should not)

Version 0.65 - 8 December 2008

- keyboarddrake:
  o configure hal so Xorg can get xkb info
    (nb: for now, you must "service haldaemon restart" to be taken into account)
- XFdrake:
  o generic flat planel must allow "800x480 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 29.82 kHz"
    so "HorizSync 31.5-90" is too strict, generating "HorizSync 29.5-90"
  o have Option "PanelGeometry" "XXxYY" on geode driver
  o do not display the weird ratios 128/75, 85/48 (for 1024x600 and 1360x768)
  o do not load "Type1" module by default (disabled in xserver-1.5.x)
  o special hack for gdium: the "default monitor" is "Plug'n Play" instead of
    good_default_monitor() (it will work since the resolution is passed to the
    kernel on gdium)
  o there is no reason "automatic" resolution should imply "automatic" color
    depth
- mousedrake, XFdrake:
  o do not use /dev/mouse symlink (in xorg.conf)
- mousedrake
  o do not propose to test the chosen mice
    (it doesn't handle evdev/synaptics and so is quite obsolete nowadays)

Version 0.64 - 1 October 2008

- XFdrake:
  o explicitly Load or Disable module "dri"
    (to be independent of Xorg's default choice)

  o fix lithuanian keyboard choices (cf #41031)
- XFdrake:
  o do set a background image when using resolution "Automatic" (#43644)

- XFdrake:
  o allow xorg.conf to have no "Monitor" section (#42793)
  o [bugfix] fix clicking on "Options" when Composite is disabled 
    (regression introduced in 0.58) (#43710)

Version 0.59 - 18 August 2008

- XFdrake:
  o use 24dpp by default, even on DRI (needed for kde4)
  o ensure we don't drop non-main "Device" (when modifying "Options", #41410)
  o use nvidia-current default settings for nvidia173 as well
  o no need to force XaaNoOffscreenPixmaps, it is the default now in

- XFdrake:
  o disable "DynamicTwinView" when not using TwinView (#39171)

Version 0.54 - 25 March 2008

- keyboarddrake library:
  o in drakx-finish-install, keyboard is asked after asking country, so have a
    good default based on country too (was done for pt_BR but not fr_XX)
    (#39221)

Version 0.53 - 21 March 2008

- XFdrake:
  o allow to set "EXA" on "intel" driver (#39162)

- XFdrake:
  o add option "Force display mode of DVI" on driver "nvidia" (#30066)   
- XFdrake library:
  o ensure set_default_background() doesn't fail (#39065)

Version 0.51 - 19 March 2008

- XFdrake:
  o use 24bpp on savage (#38750)
  o do use EDID HorizSync/VertRefresh on 16/10 (regression introduced in 0.50)
- keyboarddrake:
  o default romanian keyboard is qwerty (cf #38450)
  o "ro" really is "ro(std_cedilla)" 
    (to be more standard on unpatched xkeyboard-config)
  o "ro(us)" is wrong and not qwerty, use "ro(winkeys)" which is the only
    qwertz from symbols/ro

Version 0.50 - 11 March 2008

- XFdrake:
  o if the EDID gives a valid 16/10 preferred resolution (even if duplicated),
    but no HorizSync/VertRefresh, use a generic flat panel
    HorizSync/VertRefresh (needed for edid.lcd.dell-inspiron-6400, #37971)
  o handle DRIVER2_NO_SSE (from Cards+), needed by nvidia-current requiring SSE

Version 0.49 - 28 February 2008
