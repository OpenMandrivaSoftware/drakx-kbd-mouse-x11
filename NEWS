- keyboarddrake:
  o do not configure hal directly, but write in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard Xkb
    information so hal can get them
  o correctly handle default XkbModel
    (so that we do not force pc105 when we should not)

Version 0.65 - 8 December 2008

- keyboarddrake:
  o configure hal so Xorg can get xkb info
    (nb: for now, you must "service haldaemon restart" to be taken into account)
- XFdrake:
  o generic flat planel must allow "800x480 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 29.82 kHz"
    so "HorizSync 31.5-90" is too strict, generating "HorizSync 29.5-90"
  o have Option "PanelGeometry" "XXxYY" on geode driver
  o do not display the weird ratios 128/75, 85/48 (for 1024x600 and 1360x768)
  o do not load "Type1" module by default (disabled in xserver-1.5.x)
  o special hack for gdium: the "default monitor" is "Plug'n Play" instead of
    good_default_monitor() (it will work since the resolution is passed to the
    kernel on gdium)
  o there is no reason "automatic" resolution should imply "automatic" color
    depth
- mousedrake, XFdrake:
  o do not use /dev/mouse symlink (in xorg.conf)
- mousedrake
  o do not propose to test the chosen mice
    (it doesn't handle evdev/synaptics and so is quite obsolete nowadays)

Version 0.64 - 1 October 2008

- XFdrake:
  o explicitly Load or Disable module "dri"
    (to be independent of Xorg's default choice)

  o fix lithuanian keyboard choices (cf #41031)
- XFdrake:
  o do set a background image when using resolution "Automatic" (#43644)

Version 0.59 - 18 August 2008

- XFdrake:
  o use 24dpp by default, even on DRI (needed for kde4)
  o ensure we don't drop non-main "Device" (when modifying "Options", #41410)
  o use nvidia-current default settings for nvidia173 as well

    x11-server

Version 0.58 - 9 June 2008

- XFdrake:
  o Composite is now the default in xserver 1.4 (#35043)
  o do not create symlink /etc/X11/X to ../../usr/bin/Xorg (#41363)

Version 0.57 - 2 April 2008

- XFdrake:
  o workaround pb with nvidia driver: make dm restart xserver (#38297)

    (#39221)

Version 0.53 - 21 March 2008

- XFdrake:
  o allow to set "EXA" on "intel" driver (#39162)

Version 0.51 - 19 March 2008

- XFdrake:
  o use 24bpp on savage (#38750)
  o do use EDID HorizSync/VertRefresh on 16/10 (regression introduced in 0.50)
- keyboarddrake:
  o default romanian keyboard is qwerty (cf #38450)
  o "ro" really is "ro(std_cedilla)" 
    (to be more standard on unpatched xkeyboard-config)
  o "ro(us)" is wrong and not qwerty, use "ro(winkeys)" which is the only
    qwertz from symbols/ro

Version 0.50 - 11 March 2008

- XFdrake:
  o if the EDID gives a valid 16/10 preferred resolution (even if duplicated),
    but no HorizSync/VertRefresh, use a generic flat panel
    HorizSync/VertRefresh (needed for edid.lcd.dell-inspiron-6400, #37971)
  o handle DRIVER2_NO_SSE (from Cards+), needed by nvidia-current requiring SSE

Version 0.49 - 28 February 2008

- XFdrake: background images are now jpeg files

    (needed for edid.lcd.Elonex-PR600)

Version 0.42 - 22 January 2008

- XFdrake:
  o sort monitors in text mode so that "Generic|..." monitors do not appear 
    in the middle of "Vendor|..." monitors
- use SendCoreEvents instead of AlwaysCore for wacoms

Version 0.39 - 30 November 2007, by Anssi Hannula

- keyboarddrake:
  o use kr(kr104) for the korean keyboard, and don't prompt for a toggle key
    since korean use input method instead

- fix typo in 0.32: don't wrongly default to "automatic" resolution when
  creating xorg.conf (in non --auto)

- monitor-probe-using-X can now return EDIDs. if Xorg find an EDID (whereas
